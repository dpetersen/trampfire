/*
So, why does this exist?  Well:
- Can't require_tree from the web_app, because it will load up
  stylesheets everywhere, not just in assets.  In the deployment bot,
  that means stylesheets from checked out projects.
- Can't use globs in any of this, so can't be specific.
- No symlink following, no ERB.

= require_tree ../github/assets
= require_tree ../pivotal_tracker/assets
= require_tree ../deployment/assets
